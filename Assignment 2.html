  <h1> MORE MARKUP TRICKS WOO </h1>
    <p> So apparently the different heading sizes was a part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> chapter , I was using it on the first assignment haha.
    </p>
   <h2> lets say I was making a script… </h2>
     <p> 
it could be about anything , like I just got the rights to <acronym title=“MortalKombat”>MK</acronym> and I make a movie about it. With all the extra markups I learned from this chapter i can make things a lot easier to <del>make sense</del> <ins>convey</ins>           
     </p>
   
   <h3> lets try something else </h3>
    <p> 
I can’t think of a clever example for the rest of these so ill just put them out there to atleast test my memory. From my understanding <strong> strong </strong> and <b> bold </b> are the same thing , <em> emphasis </em> and <i> italic </i> are the same. Blockquote didn’t make sense to me but I’m assuming its like how you can add a link to a piece of text ?  Quotes are pretty self explanatory so I have no problem there. I think thats all of them.
    <p>

     <h4> Some more markups I don’t really care about </h4>
      <p> 
theres this one called cite? it doesn’t really serve a different purpose just used   in special context like when referring to someones work or something… then theres one for adding your address , I don’t know. Cool shit. I didn’t really cover every single markup they taught in this chapter but I hope this covers it.
